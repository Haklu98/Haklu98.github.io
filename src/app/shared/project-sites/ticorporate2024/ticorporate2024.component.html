  <h2 class="project-title">2024 Ticorporate Project</h2>
  <p>I was part of the development team that took on the project from Elisa during the 2024 Ticorporate.
    Our goal was to develop a collaboration tool that both companies could use to ease their communication and provide more transparency.
    This would allow the companies to work more efficiently and effectively. Over the past 4,5 months we worked with this project to meet our clients needs
    and put out the best possible software.
  </p>
  <h3>My role</h3>
  <p>I was the Project Manager and also responsible for the front-end development of the project, using Angular as the framework to bring the vision of our UI designer to life.
    With that said, I also worked closely with our UI/UX designer to create the best possible user experience. Over the course of this project I was able to
    gain a lot of experience in Angular, Typescript, HTML, CSS, and SCSS, while also getting insight on how the frontend communicates with the backend and database.
  </p>

  <h3>The process</h3>
  <p>We used scrum process with our team to keep on track what's going on with the project and who is doing what.
    This greatly increased the efficiency and quality of our work and allowed us to learn what it is like to work in a scrum team.
    First three sprints were week long, but after the production properly started, we had 2 week long sprints.
  </p>
  <p>At the start of every sprint we had a sprint planning and we went through the backlog and prioritized the tasks we had to complete.
    During the sprints we had daily scrums every day at 09:15, where everyone would go through what they were working on that day.
    At the end of the sprint we had a review on what we were able to achieve and a retrospective where we went through what we did, what went well and what could be improved.
  </p>
  <h3>Sprint 1</h3>
  <p>During the first sprint, we went through the roles of the team members and discussed with the Elisa's PO on what should be done first. We came to the conclusion that
    the most important thing to focus on was the interviewing of the clients and getting information on what is needed if this type of software was to be introduced.
    During this sprint we also created the GitHub repository and created a crude version of the product backlog.
  </p>
  <p>So all in all, the first sprint was mainly setting up the team for the project and coming up with questions to ask the clients.
    We were also able to hold the first interview during the first sprint.
  </p>
  <h3>Sprint 2</h3>
  <p>The second sprint started with us inviting the Elisa personnel to interviews and setting up the interview questions for them. This sprint was
    mainly just interviewing and gathering information from the Elisa and Jamk personnel.
  </p>
  <h3>Sprint 3</h3>
  <p>During the third sprint we took the feedback from the interviews and decided to do two different Figma-prototypes that would be shown to the clients on both the Elisa and Jamk side.
    After getting feedback on the prototypes, we were able to construct the final UI/UX prototype that would become the guideline for the project. We also
    designed the database structure and started creating the architecture of the software.
  </p>
  <h3>Sprint 4</h3>
  <p>The fourth sprint was the first sprint where we started coding and actually developing the software.</p>
  <p>I set up the angular project and pushed it to GitHub and wrote down instructions on the Git workflow. Together with the other team members, we
    created the Angular infrastructure so it would be as clear as possible. Then I created the main components for the project, the navigation and routing.
    I also added the Privacy Policy and About Us -pages. I also implemented the use of Flowbite to our project.
  </p>
  <p>During the second week of this sprint, I delved into the Angular Calendar module and started coding the yearly view -component as well as the Monthly View.
    We also did a visit to Elisa's office to get to know the company better. I also created a little greeting for the front page that changes depending on what time it is.
    During the end of the sprint, I decided to personally discard the idea of using
    the Angular Calendar module and instead create my own.
  </p>
  <p>What I actually did this sprint:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Created the Angular project and pushed it to GitHub</li>
    <li>Wrote down instructions on the Git workflow</li>
    <li>Created the Angular infrastructure with the team</li>
    <li>Created the components for the project</li>
    <li>implemented the use of Flowbite</li>
    <li>Created the Navigation and routing for the project</li>
    <li>Created the "Privacy Policy" and "About" pages</li>
    <li>Studied the Angular Calendar module</li>
    <li>Started coding the Yearly View -component</li>
    <li>Coding the Monthly View -component</li>
    <li>Discarded the Angular Calendar</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Sprint 5</h3>
  <p>During this sprint I started creating my own monthly calendar module and coding it. We also noticed that the Flowbite would not work as intended on Angular 18,
    so we decided to switch to Angular Material. This resulted in the removal of Flowbite and its dependencies, and replacing all the components with Angular Material.
    I also took on the task of cleaning up the html, creating classes for the elements and moving the Tailwind classes to css files.
  </p>
  <p>What I actually did this sprint:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Coded the monthly calendar module</li>
    <li>Added the functionality of the monthly calendar getting the events from the database</li>
  </ul>
